# unit-4-game

This game was created by Eric Fuller with direction from the UT Coding Bootcamp.  

You play the game by clicking the crystals, whose values remain hidden, at the bottom of the page to add to your total score, trying to match that score to the random number that is generated at the start of the game.  If you land directly on the number, you win.  If you go over, you lose.

Thank you for playing and I hope you have hours upon hours upon days upon weeks upon months of fun with this game.
